# SC1015-Heart Disease
SC1015 Project

## About
This is the repo for the SC1015 mini-project. The aim of the this project is to predict the presence of heart disease/cardiovascular disease with the dataset from [UCI Machine Learning Repository.](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease "UCI ML")

## Models Used
1. Decision Tree
2. Random Forest
3. Logistic Regression

## Conclusion
1. Heart Disease can be predicted with a reasonable degree of accuracy using the ML models
2. 

## Lessons Learnt
* Trade-offs when encountering missing values: deletion vs imputation
* Concept of imputation and the methods to carry it out
* Concept of over/undersampling
* Refactoring imbalanced categorical data 
* RandomForest Classifier
* Hyperparameter tuning with gridsearchCV
* Logistic Regression
* Google Colaboratory (which is not very great, will stick to Git in the future)
